# Analyzing intraoperative EEG data
This toolbox helps with the pre-processing of EEG recorded from 4-channel SEDLine device (or similar devices). It also provides examples for estimation of power, functional connectivity and complexity metrics for such data. 

The codes are provided in two sections: prep-processing and feature extraction. 

## Pre-processing

Pre-processing is currently done in MATLAB. You can load your data using [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/). You can then call one of the pre-processing functions (`preprocess_epoch.m` or `preprocess_channel.m`).
