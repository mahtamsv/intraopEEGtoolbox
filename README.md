# Analyzing intraoperative EEG data
This toolbox helps with the pre-processing of EEG recorded from 4-channel SEDLine device (or similar devices). It also provides examples for estimation of power, functional connectivity and complexity metrics for such data. 

The codes are provided in two sections. The first is files needed for pre-processing of the data. Your data can be in an EEGLAB EEG data structure and you can call one of the pre-processing functions (`preprocess_epoch.m` or `preprocess_channel.m`).
